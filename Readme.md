## Why

I wanted the funcitonality

## Run locally

For the frontend, in `frontend-svelte`, run `npm run dev`

For the packend, in functions, run `python main.py`

To use the local backend, in `frontend-sevelte/src/main.ts` switch out the server to `http://localhost:8080`

NOTE  functions_framework --target recognize


## Deploy

Frontend is deployed at github pages with `npm run deploy`

Backend is deployed with the command specified in the backend readme

## License

Ping me if one is required

## The code

Its a mess. Please don't judge me too hasty
